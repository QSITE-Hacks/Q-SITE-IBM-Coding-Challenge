    "## Lab 3: Utility-scale Circuits\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will explore how to create large circuits that use over 100 qubits. This lab is inspired by a research paper published by IBM in June 2023 entitled ***Evidence for the utility of quantum computing before fault tolerance*** in the journal Nature (see paper [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06096-3)). In the paper, researchers demonstrated meaningful computations of a real physics problem using over 100 qubits with high fidelity results. At this scale, the computations were beyond the capability of classical computers to perform the same computation using brute-force classical algorithms. This is what we refer to as **utility-scale quantum computing**. Programmers need to be mindful of the topology of the quantum processor in order to implement circuits that are both efficient and that will produce high fidelity results. The paper's authors took this into account in their computations. They also used techniques that were able to overcome noise and errors in the system using a combination of error suppression and error mitigation methods.\n",

This lab has 5 graded exercises.\n",

    "### Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper ***Evidence for the utility of quantum computing before fault tolerance*** considered a physics problem on the dynamics of a lattice of particles with a \"spin\" property. The spins of the system are influenced by a global transerve field. Mathematically, the system is described by the following Hamiltonian operator:\n",
    "\n",
    "$H = -J \\sum_{i,j}{Z_i Z_j} + h \\sum_i X_i$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $J$ is the coupling coefficient of nearest neighbour spins, $h$ is the global transverse field coefficient, and $Z$ and $X$ are the Pauli Z and Pauli X operator, respectively. Spin dynamics can be simulated over time using a technique known as Trotterization, which breaks up the computation into short time steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "The particles in the lattice can be arranged in a multitude of ways. In the simplest case, the spins can be a one-dimensional chain with each spin interacting with up to two nearest-neighbours. For the paper, the authors considered a two-dimensional lattice arranged in a heavy-hexagonal pattern, with each spin interacting with up to 3 nearest-neighbours. "

    "#### Exercise 1a: Constructing a custom gate\n",
    "\n",
    "The first exercise will be to create a two-qubit circuit that represents the implementation of a high-level gate used in the paper: the $R_{ZZ}(\\theta)$ gate. This gate is used to simulate the $Z_i Z_j$ terms in the Hamiltonian equation above. There is an implementation of this gate in Qiskit (see [here](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/api/qiskit/qiskit.circuit.library.RZZGate)). The parameter $\\theta$ represents a rotation angle. The generic $R_{ZZ}(\\theta)$ gate can be implemented with more common gates in a number of ways. In the paper, the authors considered the specific angle $\\theta = -\\pi/2$. In this case, the $R_{ZZ}(-\\pi/2)$ gate can be implemented as follows:\n",

The $\\dag$ symbol on the gate signifies that the gate is the \"adjoint\" version of the gate, which in this case means a negative phase shift instead of a positive one. See [here](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/api/qiskit/qiskit.circuit.library.SdgGate) on how to use this gate in Qiskit.\n",
    "- **$\\sqrt{Y}$ (and $\\sqrt{Y}^\\dag$)**: the square root Y gate (and it's adjoint). This rotates a qubit about it's Y-axis by $\\pi/2$. It's similar to the $\\sqrt{X}$ gate that you may have noticed in transpiled circuits, except that it involves the Y-axis instead of the X-axis. Qiskit does not have a ready-made $\\sqrt{Y}$ gate available. You'll need to find an alternative using one of the standard gates available in Qiskit (see [here](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/api/qiskit/circuit_library#standard-gates))."

You should notice that 1) there is a lot of idle time on each of the qubits when gates are not being applied to them, and 2) the depth of the circuit, i.e. the number of gates that must be executed sequentially, is somewhat large. We can calculate the gate depth of this circuit in terms of the number of sequential two-qubits gates that need to be executed. Since two-qubit gates, such as CNOT, tend to be the longest duration and the most error-prone gates on real hardware, the two-qubit gate depth of a circuit is a good indication of well the circuit will perform.

    "In addition the circuit, the simulation of the spin lattice and the quantities that we want to measure require that we define an observable operator. An observable is defined using a set of Pauli operators, specified using the I, Z, X, Y operators in Pauli \"strings\". The quantity we are interested in measuring in this lab is the average magnetization $M_z$ of the spins along the $z$-axis. For this, we need to take a measurement of all of the qubits in the $Z$ basis (which is just the standard measurement basis on IBM Quantum systems), compute an expectation value of the observable for each qubit, and then compute the average of the expected values. First, we need to define the observable operators for the measurements. In this case, it will be a set of Pauli strings with a single $Z$ operator at the position of the qubit to measure, and $I$ operators on other qubits. For instance, the Pauli string for the observable on the 5-th qubit will be ```IIIIIIIIIIIZIIII``` for a 16-qubit circuit. The code below defines the needed observables as a list of ```SparsePaulOp``` objects."

As with that system, Eagle processors (and subsequent generations of IBM Quantum processors) have many of the qubits connected to three nearest-neighbours, while other qubits are only connected to two.

The spin lattice should have the same layout as the 127-qubit Eagle processor, such as ```ibm_brisbane```. Use the same $R_{ZZ}$ gate that you created previously in this lab. The final circuit should have a 2-qubit gate depth of 3 by efficiently exploiting the qubit connectivity to execute multiple 2-qubit gates in parallel, and organized into layers. Submit your transpiled circuit, which should also have a 2-qubit gate depth of 3, to the grader.\n",

Otherwise, you are going to have some long lists to create manually! If you successfully provide a valid answer to the grader function for this exercise, your code may be further judged by the hackathon organizers on the originality of your approach to solving this problem and awarded additional merit. \n",
